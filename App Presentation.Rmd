## Introduction

This application uses the **Iris Flower Data Set** to build 2 prediction models.
The outcome is iris specie and the predictors are morphologic variations. 
Based on sepal and petal dimensions entered by the user, the application shows
the most probable iris specie. Both models present an accuracy of around 96%. 
For few cases, they show different outcomes (iris species).

## Data Set

```{r, comment= "", echo = TRUE}
head(iris)
```
```{r, comment= "", echo = TRUE}
summary(iris)
```

## Prediction

- **Random Forest** and **Linear Discriminant Analysis** were trained using 80%
of the original data set (**training** data set) with 10-fold cross validations:
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)
metric <- "Accuracy"
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y = iris$Species,p=0.8,list=FALSE)
training<- iris[inTrain,]
testing<- iris[-inTrain,]
model1 <- train(Species ~., data = training, method = "rf", metric = metric,
                trControl = control)
model2 <- train(Species ~., data = training, method = "lda", metric = metric,
                trControl = control)
```
- Models are tested on the **testing** data set:
```{r comment="", echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
model1_prediction <- predict(model1, testing)
model2_prediction <- predict(model2, testing)
```
- Accuracy is given by calculating the confusion matrix:
```{r comment="", echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
accuracy_model1 <- confusionMatrix(model1_prediction, testing$Species)
accuracy_model1 <- accuracy_model1$overall['Accuracy']
accuracy_model2 <- confusionMatrix(model2_prediction, testing$Species)
accuracy_model2 <- accuracy_model2$overall['Accuracy']
```
